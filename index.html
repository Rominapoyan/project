        “I am seeking. I am striving. I am in it with all my heart.”
        
        Vincent Van Gogh
        Vincent Van Gogh‘s paintings are adored around the world. His unique post-impressionist technique, with swathing brushstrokes and striking colors, is instantly recognizable.
        While alive, the artist’s work was not so well received and he sold very few of his paintings. He became posthumously celebrated and now he is one of the most famous painters ever to have lived, with his original artworks selling for millions. Some of Van Gogh’s most expensive paintings include the Portrait de l’artiste sans barbe (1889) which sold for $71.5 million in 1998 and Portrait du Docteur Gachet (1890) which sold for $82.5 million in 1990. While many original Van Gogh paintings are scattered around the world’s greatest museums and private collections, many of them now sit in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.

        The Most Famous Paintings by Vincent Van Gogh
        An incredibly prolific artist – although much of his work was created in the last 10 years of his life – Van Gogh produced around 2000 artworks during his lifetime, and each carries with it a special part of the artist’s legacy. Here is a selection of his most famous paintings.
        
        Starry Night, 1889
        Van Gogh’s painting Starry Night (1889), is one of his most iconic. Leading up to this point, Van Gogh had been suffering from mental health issues, so much so that it led to him cutting off his left ear. After this incident, in 1888 he was admitted to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence to recover. The view that we see in Starry Night is actually inspired by the view that Van Gogh saw from his bedroom in the asylum. The swirling blues of the moonlit night sky have become synonymous with the artist’s style and the emotional quality of his use of color.

        Sunflowers, 1889
        During his time in Arles, South of France, in the years 1888-89, Van Gogh created five paintings of sunflowers in a vase, using only shades of yellow and a touch of green. He wrote that for him sunflowers represented “gratitude” and so hung one of them in his home. Later, his friend and fellow artist Paul Gaugin, while living with him for a short while, said that he very much liked the works and asked Van Gogh for one of the paintings, which he was given. Today, this copy sits in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. </p>

        <h1>Self-Portrait, 1889</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Van Gogh painted many self-portraits during the course of his career, no fewer than 35. The one displayed below, painted in 1889, is one of his most famous. Van Gogh depicted himself wearing what he used to work in – his blue jacket and shirt. In an attempt to be as true to himself as possible, he depicts his sharp features, the furrow in his brow, and the striking red tones of his hair and beard. This is one of the final self-portraits he painted before his death the following year. </p>
